**TL;DR;**: A new major version of type-safe ODM for Firestore is out with a brand new API and docs website.

## What is Typesaurus?

Typesaurus is a universal wrapper around Firestore Web and Admin SDKs, enabling you to use the same database code on the client and server. It allows you to define your database schema in TypeScript types and checks all operations for correctness. It helps to catch bugs, prevent runtime errors, and ensure data consistency. On top of that, it provides API sugar and a first-class React integration, is lightweight, and has zero dependencies. Interested?

## About this version

You probably never heard of it, but Typesaurus has been around for a while. I published the very first version 5 years ago. Back then it was just a basic wrapper that added type-safety to Firestore.

Since then, it has evolved a lot. I used it fulltime and whenever I would find a bug or data incositency caused by a Firestore quirck or types, I would make the types even more smarter. I also added a lot of API sugar and React integration.

Two years ago I came to the point where the original API design didn't hold anymore. The types were brittle and slow, many checks that I wanted to add just didn't resolve and resulted in never. So with accumulated expiurience I reimagined the API from scratch and started working on Typesaurus X.

I decided to skip few versions to get that sweet X inspired by Apple's MacOS X. Unfortunetely during the time Twitter was overtaken by Elon Musk and renamed to X. While it makes me cringe to think about this associantion, I decided to stick with the name.

The rewrite tooks a lot of time, but I'm happy with the result. Along with new advanced API, the version also comes with [a brand new docs website](https://typesaurus.com/). I maticusly documented every single API method and added a lot of guides and examples. I hope you will find it useful.

### Quick demo

Without further ado, let's see Typesaurus in action. Here's a simple blog post component (don't worry you don't have to use React, it's just an example):

```ts
import { db } from "./db";
import { useRead } from "@typesaurus/react";

export interface PostProps {
  slug: string;
}

export function PostPage(props: PostProps) {
  // Query post by slug
  const [result] = useRead(
    db.posts.query(($) => $.field("slug").eq(props.slug))
  );
  const post = result?.[0];

  const [comments] = useRead(
    // Wait for post to load before loading comments
    post?.ref.id &&
      db
        .posts(post.ref.id)
        .comments.query(($) => $.field("publishedAt").order()).on // ðŸ‘ˆ .on enables real-time updates
  );

  if (!post) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <PostPreview post={post} />
      <hr />
      <Comments post={post} comments={comments} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example we queried a post by slug and then subscribed to real-time updates of its comments. And it's all without writing a single line of API!

You might be wondering, what is this `db` object? With Typesaurus, you define your database schema in in single place. Here's how it looks like:

```ts
import { Typesaurus, schema } from "typesaurus";

export const db = schema(($) => ({
  posts: $.collection<Post>().sub({
    comments: $.collection<Comment>(),
  }),
}));

export type Schema = Typesaurus.Schema<typeof db>;

export interface Post {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  text: string;
  publishedAt: Typesaurus.ServerDate;
}

export interface Comment {
  name: string;
  text: string;
  publishedAt: Typesaurus.ServerDate;
}
```

In the example we have a basic database with `posts` collection and `comments` `subcollection`.

You will use the same `db` object on the client and server. Typesaurus resolves which adapter to use via [`package.json`'s exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports). When bundling for the client, it will use Firestore Web SDK, when bundling for the server, it will use Firestore Admin SDK.

This is how a server-side code might look like:

```ts
import { db } from "./db";
import { groups } from "typesaurus";

const comments = await groups(db).comments.all();

await Promise.all(
  comments.map(async (comment) => {
    const offensive = await isOffensive(comment);
    if (offensive) await comment.remove();
  })
);
```

Now when you see it in action, let's dive into the details.

## Why to use it?

Ok, this looks sweet, but why to bother to use a wrapper, is there anything beyond the sugar?

Unlike traditional SQL database Firestore is extremely flexible database. It allows to make your documents of practically any shape. While itâ€™s extremely convenient, unless youâ€™re careful your documents might get into state that you donâ€™t expect and cause runtime errors, lost data and a lot of headache.

That's where types come in play preserving flexibility while adding structure and preserving your data consistency.

It not only adds types to your data, but also protects your from Firestore pitfalls, like having nested arrays, server dates being `null` on the client, or `undefined` values causing exceptions. It will warn and guide you before you make a mistake.

Having your database schema defined in a single place serves as a documentation and makes it easy to understand how the data is structured.

On top of that, Typesaurus provides single unified API for both client and server, which makes it easy to share and reuse your code.

Typesaurus is packed with features, but it's also lightweight and has zero dependencies. It tooks me weeks to just describe what it does in the docs, so there's no way I'm going to cover everything in this post.

Instead I suggest you to [follow the Getting Started guide](https://typesaurus.com/get-started/) and discover Typesaurus yourself.

## Roadmap

I might sound cliche but Iâ€™m actually getting started. I believe Typesaurus X will provide long-lasting foundation and wonâ€™t drastically change anymore, but thereâ€™re many things around the ecosystem that I want to do.

I already had working MVP of TypeScript DSL for writing security rules. I want make it happen for X too.

I want to have first-class integration with Firebase Functions.

I have plan to build tight integration with Next.js so docs can be easily passed between server and client components.

I would like to make migrating Firestore a trivial task.

Thereâ€™s Realtime Database that also begs for type-safety.

I can go on and on, so if youâ€™re interested - follow me on Twitter and sponsor me at GitHub!
